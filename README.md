# TestAppCAW

## üì± Overview
**TestAppCAW** is an Android application developed as part of a technical assessment for the **Product Developer (Android SDK)** role. The app demonstrates integration with a REST API using Retrofit, local data storage with Room, and clean architectural practices.

---
## üöÄ Features
- **API Integration:** Retrieves data from an external API.
- **Local Storage:** Saves data using Room Database.
- **MVVM Architecture:** Ensures separation of concerns and maintainability.
- **RecyclerView Implementation:** Displays data efficiently.
- **hilt Integration:** helps in dependency injection.
- **Firebase Integration:** Monitors crash analytics and network performance.

---
## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Kotlin** ‚Äì Primary programming language.
- **Retrofit** ‚Äì For API communication.
- **Room Database** ‚Äì For local storage.
- **Firebase Crashlytics & Performance Monitoring** ‚Äì For monitoring app stability and performance.
- **ViewModel & LiveData** ‚Äì For managing UI-related data.
- **Coroutines** ‚Äì For handling asynchronous tasks.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Getting Started
### 1. To Clone the repository
Run command : 
git clone https://github.com/kshitij9799/TestAppCAW.git

---
## üé® Design Decisions
### 1. Bottom Navigation for Task Management
- Implemented a **Bottom Navigation Menu** with two options:
    - **Completed Tasks:** Displays a list of tasks that have been marked as completed.
    - **Pending Tasks:** Shows a list of tasks that are yet to be completed.

### 2. Pending Tasks ‚Äì Online & Offline Mode
- **Toggle Options for Task Source:**
    - **Offline Mode:** Retrieves and displays tasks stored locally using **Room Database**.
    - **Online Mode:** Fetches publicly available mock API data using **Retrofit** to provide real-time task updates.

### 3. Clean and Modular Architecture
- Applied **MVVM Architecture** to ensure clear separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and data sources.
- Maintained modularity to facilitate future scalability and maintenance.

### 4. Offline Data Persistence
- Used **Room Database** to store task data locally, ensuring data availability in offline scenarios.
- Proper synchronization is maintained when switching between online and offline modes.
